**Any known bugs?**
> Sometimes the cursor will drag the elements instead of clicking on them and for some reason the browser can't understand the following: 
>  ```javascript
>  divElement.draggable =  false; 
>  divElement.ondrag =  "return false";
>  ```
>  No way it's me not knowing how to disable it... right?... right?
